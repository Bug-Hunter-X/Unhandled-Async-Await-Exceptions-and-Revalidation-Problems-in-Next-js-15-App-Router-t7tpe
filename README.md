# Unhandled Async/Await Exceptions and Revalidation Problems in Next.js 15 App Router

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15's App Router related to the improper handling of asynchronous operations and revalidation.  The initial example shows a flawed API route that doesn't handle potential errors thrown during an asynchronous fetch. The solution demonstrates robust error handling and improved revalidation strategies.
