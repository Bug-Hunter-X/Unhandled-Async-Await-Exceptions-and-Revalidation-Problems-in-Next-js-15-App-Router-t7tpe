In Next.js 15, issues can arise with the introduction of the `app` directory and its new routing system. One uncommon error involves incorrect usage of `async/await` within API routes or during data fetching in the `app` directory.  For example, forgetting to handle exceptions properly within an `async` function can lead to unexpected behavior, silent failures, or crashes.  Another subtle issue could involve incorrect use of `revalidate` within `fetch` calls, leading to stale data or unexpected caching behavior.  Improperly handling edge runtime specific functions could also produce problems.
